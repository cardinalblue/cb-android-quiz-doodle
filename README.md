Take Home Assignment - Doodle Android
===

The subject of the assignment is to:

- Implement the stroke drawing function with BLACK color and fixed stroke width, where we want to see how familiar you are with the Android touch event and the system design for the sketch editor.
- (Optional and plus) Get familiar with MVP and Reactive programming because our developers are heavily using the paradigm.
- (Optional and plus) Implement the canvas erasing function.

#### Here are some tips

You might just need to focus on SketchContract, SketchView and SketchEditorPresenter files, where SketchContract defines the input and output interfaces of VIEW (in a MODEL-VIEW-PRESENTER pattern); SketchView is the implementation of VIEW; Lastly, SketchEditorPresenter contains the business logic.

Feel free to ask us anything and we look forward to seeing your submission.
